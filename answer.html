      <h1>ANSWER:</h1>
      <div class="filter-effects">
        <p>Eyes and lips slightly bigger</p>
        <p>Clearing blemishes, smoothing skin</p>
        <p>Narrowing the bridge of the nose</p>
      </div>

      <h1>WHY DOES IT MAKE THESE CHANGES?</h1>
      <p>
        It's increasingly common to come across 'beauty filters' like these. In
        one click, they promise an 'instantly improved' version of your face.
        You, just prettier.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the technology is not neutral. Filters are designed by humans, who
        have different cultural and historical biases over what 'beauty' means,
        and who is, and who should be beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 'beauty' tweaks in the filter you just used are based on
        contemporary Western beauty norms for women.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Big eyes</strong> and a <strong>small nose</strong> are
          associated with children and youth: women must look eternally young to
          be considered beautiful.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Big lips</strong> are seen to signal sexual availability,
          reflecting the racist representation of black women in the West.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clear, unmarked skin</strong> has historically signalled class
          privilege: a sheltered life free of hard work in the sun.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Our research aims to question how technology is embedding exclusionary
        cultural norms of judgment and unequal value: whose faces are valued and
        privileged? How is technology further prompting us to judge some faces
        as 'needing correction'?
      </p>
      <p>
        So when you see beauty filters, ask: what kinds of old ideas about
        beauty are they re-presenting in a new, technological form? Whose beauty
        standard is embedded in suggested beauty edits? And how is technology
        nudging us to continually judge ourselves?
